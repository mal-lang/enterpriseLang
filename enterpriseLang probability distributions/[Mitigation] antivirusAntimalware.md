# [Antivirus/Antimalware](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1049/) [Mitigation]

## Context 
"Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software."

## Findings
According to a study from [SANS conducted in 2019](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/bestprac/paper/39295), 62.5% use "next gen antivirus". (It's not entirely clear to me what next-gen is in this context). A source from [dataprot.net](https://dataprot.net/statistics/antivirus-statistics/) shows that 89% of desktop PCs use antivirus, while 80% of laptops do. If we combine all of these we get that on average (62.5 + 89 + 80)/3 = 77.167% are using antivirus/antimalware in some capacity. 

## Result
The 77.167% corresponds to ```Bernoulli(0.77167)```.
