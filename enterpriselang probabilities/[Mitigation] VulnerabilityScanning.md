# [Vulnerability Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1016/)

## Context
Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them.

## Findings
I will try to find data on how good vulnerability scanning is at preventing attacks, rather than how common they are. 
In one [survey reported by scmagazineuk](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/one-fourth-global-organisations-faced-breaches-unpatched-vulnerabilities/article/1586349#:~:text=Vulnerability%20management%20starts%20with%20visibility,networks%20within%20minutes%20or%20hours.), they state that 59% of global organizations are able to detect new software hardware on their networks within "minutes or hours", as a result of vulnerability scanning. 

This [source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zero-days-fileless-attacks-are-now-the-most-dangerous-threats-to-the-enterprise/) found that 37% of attacks launched against companies were zero-day attacks, and this kind of attack vulnerability scans would not be able to prevent. So, perhaps we can assume that vulnerability scans would be able to detect 100-37 = 73% of attacks launched against attacks. 

In [a paper evaluating two vulnerability scanners](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1348588/FULLTEXT01.pdf), openvas and nexpose, the author found that openvas was 75% accurate and nexpose was 78% accurate. 

Another [paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/775d/ed35d7940b94b5bc01d568d472e59fd24775.pdf) evaluating several vulnerability scanners (AVDS, McCafee, Nessus, NeXpose, Patchlink scan, QualysGuard, SAINT), in table 11 we can see how they had 80% detection rate for authenticated scans, and 44% for UNauthenticated. 

## Result
I will combine the percentages I've found into a result of the average effectiveness of vulnerability scanning. (59+73+75+78+80+44)/6 = ~68.17%. 

-> ```Bernoulli(0.6817)```.
